SmartCart is a web application that helps Canadians reduce grocery costs by finding the cheapest way to buy their entire grocery list across stores.

SmartCart grabs live prices from grocery chains to calculate the cheapest single-store or multi-store purchasing route. It also supports custom filters such as gluten-free, vegan, Halal, Kosher, and Canadian-made.
